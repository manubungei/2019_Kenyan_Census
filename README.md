Kenya Population Interactive Map

This project visualizes Kenyan population data by county using Folium and GeoJSON. It combines geospatial data with census statistics to create an interactive map that displays population details (male, female, intersex, and total) for each county. The map is color-coded based on total population, with tooltips for detailed information.
